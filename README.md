# Project-Prophecy
Being able to learn from observed data and predict the future is an omniscient ability that people trying to obtain for decades. However, human are equipped with such ability naturally and we call it intuition. This project aims to give such ability to machines and enable them to form intuition as fast as human by utilizing FPGA acceleration on MCMC methods.
